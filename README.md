# What's this

This is a repository of my solutions presented for the challenges at [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.com).


# Contents

The planned structure is to have a directory that corresponds for each of the languages that I've worked on so far, and within them, a directory for the corresponding chapter of a set of challenges which will contain two more directories, one for the source code and the other for their relevat test cases. For example:

    ├── javascript
    │   ├── basic_algorithm_scripting
    │   │   ├── src
    │   │   └── test


# Checking it out

If you just want to see the code, just head over to any `src/` directory, but do have a look in the test cases so you have a better understanding of what they're meant to do. Also, feel free to run the tests. And here's how:

### Javascript

#### Requirements
 - [npm](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions)

#### Steps
 - `cd` into javascript directory
 - Install the node dependencies via `npm install`
 - Run `npm test`


# Tools

For javascript tests, I will be using [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), and for php the one and only [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)


# Notes

Feel free to suggest any improvement, as all of this is for the sake of learning and self-improving. You can either fork and submit a pull request, or just get a hold of me via [w0rldart.com](https://w0rldart.com) or [@w0rldart](https://twitter.com/w0rldart)
